## FFXI Edited Maps

Download [latest release](https://github.com/johan-sorman/ffxi-maps/releases/latest)
<br/>or download from source (Code dropdown > Download zip)

### Installation Options

There are two methods to install these modified maps into your FFXI client.

- Preferred method: [XIPivot](https://github.com/Shirk/XIPivot) is a dat replacement plugin available for both Windower and Ashita which allows a user to dynamically replace `.dat` files with custom versions. I advise searching for the plugin and following the setup guide. This is now the preferred method for using custom `.dat` files of any type.

- Manual method: Copy and Paste the ROM## folders directly into the `./FINAL FANTASY XI/` folder, replacing all files when prompted. This will OVERWRITE all the game dats with the updated map files.
